  <h2>How does it work?</h2>
  <h3>Genetic Algorithms (GAs) find solutions to optimization problems by utilizing techniques inspired by evolutionary genetics, where stronger individuals outcompete weaker ones.</h3>

  <div class="list">
    <ul>
      <li>Each <strong>individual</strong> in a population represents a <strong>candidate solution</strong> to a problem.</li>
      <li>Individuals contains properties (called <strong>chromosomes</strong>) which are evaluated for their <strong>fitness</strong> (how well they solve the problem).</li>
      <li>A weighted sampling of two individuals is taken based on their relative fitness scores, with more fit individuals more likely to be chosen.</li>

      <li><strong>Crossing over</strong> occurs between the chromosomes of the two individuals, producing a <strong>child</strong>.</li>
        <svg class="chromosomes"></svg>

      <li>Random mutations can occur at any index of the child's chromosome.</li>
        <svg class="mutated-chrom"></svg>

      <li>A new population is created from the children of these crossover events (the next <strong>generation</strong>).</li>

      <li>The simulation ends when a certain number of generations has been reached.</li>
    </ul>
